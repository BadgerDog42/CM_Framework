# CM_Framework
Barebones working framework for the coolermaster masterkeys SDK.

I spent some time getting the SDK up and running to play around with it.  I have received several requests for the source code
so I decided it was best to just upload it and allow anyone to grab it.  This should, in theorey, be a good working base.  I
used Visual Studio to create the project and build the code.  You should be able to use free versions of Visual Studio to use
it as is, or you could create your own project around the code.  The downside would be you need to figure out how to link the
library for yourself, but at least this exists as a guide to using the functions it provides.

The SDK should reside in a folder of its own called CoolerMAster_SDK at the same level as the CM_Test folder.

It has been a while since I did this, and my memory sucks.  There is probably a lot of other stuff I should put here like
what version of the SDK I was using and other such good stuff, but ehh, you'll figure it out.  I have faith in you, future
coder!

I won't help you write your code (what fun would that be?!) but I'm more than happy to provide some limited help in getting
this up and running.  I am hidesuru on Reddit as well so feel free to PM me there.  

Of course I say that now assuming this will never get much visibility... lets see if I rev this file in the future.  ;-)
